aws-cf-private-streaming-tools
==============================

What?
-----------
A set of ruby CLI tools for creating and modifying Amazon Cloudfront 
Private Streaming Distributions and Origin Access ID's, using the
RightAWS ruby library.

Why?
----
I created these tools a in late 2010 because I needed to setup a 
private streaming distribution (RTMP) on Amazon Cloudfront.  However,
the Amazon web management console did not support this and I could
not find any cli tools either.

Luckily the right_aws ruby libraries (>= 2.0.0) already had support 
for Private Streaming distributions, so all I had to do was put together
a few CLI wrappers to make them easy for admins to utilize.

Available Commands
------------------
#### cf-streaming-distribution.rb ####
	$ ./cf-streaming-distribution.rb --help

	Synopsis
	--------
	cf-streaming-distribution: Manipulate Amazon Cloudfront Streaming
	Distributions

	Usage
	-----
	cf-streaming-distribution.rb [OPTIONS] [command] [args]

	Commands
	--------
	  list
	      List all Streaming Distributions

	  get [aws_id]
	      Get details about the Streaming Distribution identified by [aws_id].

	  create [bucket]
	      Create new Streaming Distribution using S3 origin bucket [bucket].  CNAMEs
	      can optionally be specified with multiple --cname options, and a comment can
	      be applied with --comment option

	  delete [aws_id] [e_tag]
	      Delete the Streaming Distribution identified by [aws_id] and [e_tag].  A
	      distribution must first be disabled before it can be deleted.  Use 'get'
	      to retrieve a distribution's e_tag.

	  modify [aws_id]
	      Modify attributes on the Streaming Distribution identified by [aws_id].  Must
	      be used in conjunction with at least one of the following options:
	      --comment, --enabled, --oai, --trusted-signer, --cname

	  wait [aws_id]
	      Loop until a Streaming Distribution specified by [aws_id] enters the 'deployed'
	      state.  You could use this in scripts if you need to know when a
	      distribution becomes available for use.

#### ./cf-origin-access-id.rb ####
	$ ./cf-origin-access-id.rb --help
	Synopsis
	--------
	cf-origin-access-id:

	   List, create, delete CloudFront Origin Access Identities (OAI's), as well
	   as grant permissions on S3 objects to CloudFront OAI's.

	Usage
	-----
	cf-origin-access-id.rb [OPTIONS] [command] [args]

	commands:
	---------
	 list:
	      List Origin Access Identities

	 create [comment]
	      Create a new Origin Access Identity.  The AWS_ID and S3 Canonical ID
	      will be returned if successful

	 get [aws_id]
	      Get details about an Origin Access Identity specified by [aws_id].  This
	      command will display e_tag which is needed to delete an OAI

	 delete [aws_id] [e_tag]
	      Delete the Origin Access Identity specified by [aws_id] and [e_tag]. Use
	      'get' to retrieve the current e_tag.

	 grant [aws_id] [bucket]
	      grant 'FULL_PERMISSION' access on <tt>all</tt> objects inside the S3 bucket specified
	      by [bucket] to the OAI specified by [aws_id].  There is little reason to
	      create an OAI other than to give it permissions to some objects within S3,
	      and this command helps simplify that for you.

Example Workflow
----------------
In this example we will setup a new Cloudfront Private Streaming distribution
with the following attributes:

* S3 origin bucket:    my-video-bucket
* CF base URL (CNAME): rtmp://cf.example.com/

#### 1. Setup AWS keys ####
    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='xxxxx'
	$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='xxxxxx'

#### 2. Create a new Cloudfront Streaming Distribution ####
	$ ./cf-streaming-distribution.rb create my-video-bucket \
   		--cname cf.example.com \
 		-m "private streaming distribution (rtmp) with origin bucket: my-video-bucket"

 		Success!
		domain_name:  s1loj2pirm00it.cloudfront.net
		aws_id:       E1UGDLB9XZBD79

#### 3. Configure CNAME in your DNS server #####
This part will depend on DNS server or DNS provider.  You'll need to create a new CNAME
for cf.example.com --> s1loj2pirm00it.cloudfront.net

#### 4. Create a new Origin-Access-ID (OAI) ####
	$ ./cf-origin-access-id.rb create "OAI for use on the cf.example.com distribution"
	  Success!
	  AWS_ID           : E2CWXW7A1B3YIU
	  Location       : https://cloudfront.amazonaws.com/origin-access-identity/cloudfront/E2CWXW7A1B3YIU
	  S3 Canonical ID: 3b5285f7f1b51ff2e63e8ff8127b7ffb76edee24580cb7fff6ef812aa87b749aaa3ed1aab389aaaab4453499a7ba57e7

#### 5. Assign the OAI to the Cloudfront distribution ####
	./cf-streaming-distribution.rb modify E1UGDLB9XZBD79 --oai E2CWXW7A1B3YIU
	  Success!

#### 6. Grant the OAI access to the files in the S3 bucket ####
	$ ./cf-origin-access-id.rb grant E2CWXW8B1U3YJU my-video-bucket
	  Applying grant [E2CWXW8B1U3YJU:'FULL_CONTROL'] on: my-video-bucket/flvs/video01.flv
	  Applying grant [E2CWXW8B1U3YJU:'FULL_CONTROL'] on: my-video-bucket/flvs/video02.flv
	  ...
	
#### 7. Create RSA Keypair on the Amazon AWS website ####
You cannot create keypairs with the cloudfront API, so you'll need to do this step
on the AWS website.

* Goto http://aws.amazon.com then login:
* Account > Security Credentials > Key Pairs
* Click “Create New Key Pair” under the “Cloudfront Key Pairs” section
* A keypair will be created and the private key will automatically begin downloading. 

	You must save this file! it will be in the form “pk-XXXXXX.pem”. If you lose this key, 
	you can’t get it back because Amazon only stores the public key.
	
#### 8. Register the account and keypairs on the cloudfront distribution ####
NOTE: the --trusted-signer arguments takes an amazon account ID as an argument.  
The special ‘self’ can be used instead.

	$ ./cf-streaming-distribution.rb modify E1UGDLB9XZBD79 --trusted-signer self
	  Success!
	
#### 9. Verify settings on the new private Streaming Distribution ####
	$ ./cf-streaming-distribution.rb get E1UGDLB9XZBD79
	 AWS_ID            : E1UGDLB9XZBD79
	   E_TAG           : EQ3HGAPOK1IFN
	   Status          : InProgress
	   Enabled         : true
	   domain_name     : s1loj2pirm00it.cloudfront.net
	   origin          : my-video-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
	   CNAMEs          : cf.example.com
	   Comment         : private streaming distribution (rtmp) with origin bucket: my-video-bucket
	   Origin Access ID: origin-access-identity/cloudfront/E2CWXW7A1B3YIU
	   Trusted Signers : self
	   Active Signers:
	       -> aws_account_number: self
	            -> key_pair_id  :  APDBDOEHALFXGK5AQU5R

NOTE: The distribution will not be usable until Status changes from InProgress to Deployed. 
This can take up to 15minutes.

You can also use the command `cf-streaming-distribution.rb wait AWS_ID` to
wait for a distribution to change from InProgress to Deployed.  The command will
exit as soon as the status changes to Deployed.  This is useful for scripts
where you need to control timing.
